> A comprehensive data science pipeline analyzing Formula 1 race performance, pit strategy effectiveness, and driver/team outcomes using machine learning and advanced motorsport feature engineering.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project leverages the FastF1 Python API to extract, engineer, and model F1 race data, focusing on:

- **🎯 Race outcome prediction** using ML classification models
- **⚡ Pit stop strategy effectiveness** analysis (undercut/overcut battles)
- **📈 Pace consistency modeling** and driver performance variance
- **🌧️ Weather impact** on strategic decisions and race outcomes
- **📱 Interactive data exploration** (planned Streamlit dashboard)

### Key Differentiators

- **Custom motorsport feature engineering** beyond standard metrics
- **Rigorous methodology** with explicit assumption testing and limitation documentation
- **End-to-end reproducible pipeline** from raw telemetry to deployment-ready insights
- **Strategic focus** on actionable racing insights, not just statistical modeling

---

## 🚀 Current Achievements

### 1. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering ✅

- **Automated data extraction** from FastF1 API across multiple seasons
- **Advanced feature engineering:**
  - Pace variance (lap time consistency metrics)
  - Pit stop reconstruction from stint transitions
  - Grid-to-finish performance deltas
  - Weather impact integration
  - Team and driver performance profiling

### 2. Machine Learning Models ✅

**Points Finish Prediction Model:**
```bash
Model Type: XGBoost Classifier
Accuracy: 84%
Precision/Recall: 0.84-0.85 (balanced performance)
Target: InPoints (Top 10 finish binary classification)
```


**Key Feature Insights:**
- **Grid Position** remains the dominant predictor (as expected)
- **Team strength** and **stint strategy** provide meaningful incremental value
- **Pace consistency** often more important than raw speed for points finishes
- **Weather effects** less predictive as simple binary feature (improvement opportunity)

### 3. Strategic Analysis Framework ✅

- **Rival pair detection algorithm** for undercut/overcut pit battles
- **Position change tracking** methodology (pre/post pit windows)
- **Success rate quantification** framework ready for multi-season analysis

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-analytics.git
  cd f1-analytics

2. **Create virtual environment (recommended):**
  python -m venv f1_env
  source f1_env/bin/activate  # Windows: f1_env\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**
  pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Verify installation:**
  python -c “import fastf1; print(‘Setup complete!’)”

### Quick Start

Extract race data
  from src.data_extraction import extract_race_data race_data = extract_race_data(2023, ‘Hungarian GP’)
Engineer features
  from src.feature_engineering import engineer_features features = engineer_features(race_data)
Train model
  from src.models.points_predictor import PointsPredictor model = PointsPredictor() accuracy = model.train(features)

## 📈 Key Insights Discovered

1. **Grid position dominance confirmed** - Starting position remains the strongest race outcome predictor, but strategic factors provide meaningful incremental predictive power

2. **Pit strategy context dependency** - Undercut/overcut effectiveness varies significantly by track characteristics, weather conditions, and stint timing

3. **Consistency vs speed trade-off** - Drivers with lower lap time variance often outperform faster but inconsistent competitors in points accumulation

4. **Team strategic differences** - Quantifiable and persistent differences in pit strategy execution across constructors

5. **Weather complexity** - Simple rainfall binary classification insufficient; timing and intensity granularity needed for better prediction

---

## 🔄 Limitations & Methodology Notes

### Current Limitations
- **Single-race processing constraint** due to computational efficiency requirements
- **Binary rainfall classification** lacks timing and intensity granularity
- **Pit execution quality** not isolated from strategic decision effectiveness
- **External race events** (Safety Car, red flags) not explicitly modeled

### Intellectual Rigor Approach
- All assumptions explicitly tested and documented
- Alternative explanations considered for each finding
- Limitations and potential biases clearly stated
- Code structured for reproducibility and educational value
